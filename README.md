Iot system for infants health monitoring 

The mobile application is connected to the Terraâ€™s api to collect data from wearable devices and display vital signs of the infant to the parent 24/7 such as body temperature, heartbeat rates, blood pressure, breathing, dehydration..and issue different alertsðŸš¨in case of any disorder.

Also builded a camputer vision system to capture the infant mouvement to prevent the infants from rolling over on their stomach while sleeping, the thing that can increase the chances of getting a Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
